Most University degrees are too theoretically oriented and thus the students, when leaving the university with their diplomas, are not ready and apt to earn their own living. But this disadvantage of academic education will never discourage the young people and they will always be willing to learn and know more. There are a lot of factors that support the idea that university education is of great importance. It is crucial because it helps an individual to form his character, to test his abilities and develop them. But higher education is also responsible for the ultimate awareness that comes with maturity and experience. But, according to me, its greatest contribution is that it establishes a respect in one's own self.
University degrees are respected throughout the world, so they have a certain, if not big, value.
Young people, when applying for universities, should be prepared to learn more than they will really need in real life. But this should be so because universities should never be equal to workshops where you simply learn how to do things and then master them to perfection. Just the opposite, higher education aims at suggesting more ideas and different points of view, it aims to raise the mind and to create individuals with wide range of knowledge.
One of the most interesting things that comes with University education is that you encounter various types of people. Among the academic spheres one may get acquainted with the brightest minds of the century, one may find people that follow and share his views, one may come across people that challenge him and thus improve his point of view. The possibilities are numerous and they all have a significant positive value.
In my own opinion, every young intellectual mind should go to the University to acquire, above all, spiritual knowledge, to develop his or her consciousness, to gain respect in his own self and thus to find his proper place in life.
