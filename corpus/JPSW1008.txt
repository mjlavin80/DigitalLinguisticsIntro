I think Japanese students should study English to become international citizens. World official language is English. Not to speaking English is not to become international citizens. Many Japanese, however, can't speak English well. Why Japanese aren't good at speaking English? I think because Japanese can't listen English well. One teacher said to us that if we can't listen English well, we can't speak English. It is a right thinking. In fact, many Japanese students are weak in listening English. I think that the reason is junior and sinior high school education. They make an endevor to reading and writing English rather than speaking and listening English. So, we are good at reading and writing rather than speaking and listening. But only few people can do these perfect. It is serious problem. School education should improve their educational system. First, Japanese should start more early to learn English. I think it is late to start learning English since junior high school. If we learned English more early, we might use English more. Second, we should add to time to use English. We everyday use English in English lesson only. It is too little to use. When I was high school student, every Friday was "English Day" in my school. English teachers spoke over the speaker in English and the student on duty spoke in English at class meeting on Friday. It was nice change to use English. Other school might did like this. And school English education may be improved. The other way, I think it is good to write our diary in English and hand in it to teacher. Recently computer is popularized all over the world. Especially Internet is as important as television and newspaper. We need to read and write in English to do internet. Because, it is neccesary to write diary in English.
Japanese students need to master English. Japanese education of English is, however, so late. But we can learn English ourself by many ways. We should be able to speak, listen, read and write English. It is difficult for us to do all. But we need all in the future. "Many a little makes a mickle." As the proverb says, a little effort will be big force. Japanese students study English more to become recognized international citizens. I think it is so hard but possible thing. I think that Japanese people need to master English absolutely.¬Å@
