I think that Japanese students need to master English as a second language. Because English is spoken by many people around the world. People who speak English are not only American and Earopean. Some of countries in Asia and African use English as a official language, too. For example, India, the Philippines. Most of these countries used to be the American and European colonies. India used to be a British colony. There are many official languages in India. English is one of these languages. And Japanese began using English, because Japanese became a American colony after World War Â‡U. Today we can see many English word on various things. I think that if we don't talk English speaker, we need to learn little English world I today's Japanese. English is essential for international job. Especially, 
English is very important for foreign trade. People who work at trading company have many opportunities to speak English when they trade with other country's trading companies. So if they can't speak English, they can't work. There are many jobs which need to speak and read, write, English except it. For example, a flight attendant, a ground hostess, a interpreter, an announcer, a translator. If we want to be a interpreter and an announcers, we have to get English of pretty high level. And today is computer age. Especially internet is very popular these years. We need to understand English to make good use of a personal computer. I think that we have to make god use of carious computers in the future. The number of people who go on a trip abroad are increasing recently. Especially people often go to America and Australia, China. Many people who are in their peak English. So if you can speak English, your trip will be more pleasure. You can talk people who live in their. And you can listen to various story from their . English is very useful for our trip. I want to go to Boston early . And I want to study very hard to talk people of other countries. I also want to take my pearents to the foreign countries in the future. Needless to say, I am going to interpret for my pearents at that time. It's my dream. I have been learning English since I wan junior high school student. But I can't use English much yes. I have to study more. I go to Boston next year. I want to make good use of my precious experience for my future. Learning foreign language is very difficult. But English is well world learning.
